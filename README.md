# AnomalyDetection

This is the code for anomaly detection of bearings' vibration using PCA and Mahalanobis distance.
The data used is NASA Bearing Vibration dataset that contains 982 rows and 4 column (bearings). (BearingVibration_Dataset.csv)
File Anomaly_distance.csv shows the final data that will show what time is anomaly.
From the detection, the vibration anomaly mostly happen at date 16th and so on until 19th.
